        	<p>Hey! I'm <strong>Liz Lorena</strong>. I'm a May 2019 ITI program graduate from Rutgers University who makes websites and aspires to be a game developer. This is my blog about art, programming, and working on the Web. I have a YouTube channel and also plans for a WordPress theme store and some small games. You can find more information about me <a href="https://lizlorena.com/about">here</a>.</p>

        	<p>I started the blog because one of my creative outlets is writing, and I also wanted my own little spot on the Web that I can use as a portfolio and where I can share with others the things I have learned in various topics including branding, working online, WordPress development, and more. I have a YouTube channel on these topics, and I will also be using this site to release my future game and free and premium WordPress and Jekyll themes. Posts and videos on this blog are not sponsored unless otherwise stated in the post or video. There are no ads on this site, but my YouTube channel may run ads at some point in the future.</p>
