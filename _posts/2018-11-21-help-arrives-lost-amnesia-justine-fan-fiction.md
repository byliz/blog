<p><first-letter>T</first-letter>oday I will begin uploading a different kind of content! I wanted to share with you a fan fiction I wrote when I was 14 that I was really proud of, but I sadly lost it probably about 6 months ago. Instead I will give you a summary of what it was and the crazy way I managed to lose it.</p>

<h4>The Story</h4>

<p>If you've ever played the game <em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>, you probably have also heard of the short free expansion that was released for the game called <em>Amnesia: Justine</em>. This game had the same gameplay mechanics as the main game, but with a different story and different monsters. In this game you control a woman named Justine and escape a cellar roamed by blind humanoid monsters who will kill you if they catch you.</p>

<p>My four-part 53-page fan fiction was based on the story surrounding this game - that the woman you are playing as is the true villain because she is the one responsible for turning her ex-lovers into monsters and trapping them in the cellar in order to "test her psyche". These men were cut up, blinded, and starved with their arms and legs bound in chains and their bodies weighed down by wheels around their necks. Just who knows how long they were tortured and kept down in Justine Florbelle's basement? I was frustrated that there was no justice for the three suitors in the game, as the ending only gives us answers about what we just experienced, not what happens next. Therefore, my fan fiction was basically a long rescue fantasy that wasn't executed too well, but I was still happy that people left positive comments and reviews on it, especially since I was really proud of the hard work I put into it.</p>

<p>"Help Arrives", as my fan fiction was titled, follows a group of cops and a young woman who may as well have been a self-insert as they go down into the basement where the three men are kept and rescue them. Admittedly, I think I half-assed the pacing because I basically narrated how you go about beating the game and discovering all of the pieces of information about the lore and backstory such as letters and audio clips. </p>

<p>The first part is about rescuing Aloïs Racine, a former tennis player who is kept in the cells area. I had a soft spot for this character because he was madly in love with Justine to the point of self-harming. It is also revealed in his letter to her that he was angry about the supposed abuse by her other lovers towards her. The second part is about rescuing Basile Giroux, who is in the library area of the basement. He is the angriest of the monsters, but he has retained the most sanity. The third part was about rescuing Malo de Vigny, a former violin virtuoso, in the flooded dungeon. He is the most insane of the trio, to the point where he wants to cannibalize Justine, and he has the best sense of hearing thanks to his musical talent. In this section, I believe the cops also rescue another policeman called Inspector Marot, who had been sent earlier to arrest Justine. </p>

<p>Up until this point my readers were happy with the story, but the final chapter disappointed some of them. The fourth chapter was my more original work, and I can remember spending my free time at school writing it all out and making countless revisions with pencil and paper. I wanted this story to have a happy ending, so the last chapter had the three suitors and the cops testifying in court against Justine, whose sentence is changed from life to death for escaping and attempting to kill the female self-insert character. This whole scene was ridiculous, and it really showed how little I knew about court systems, much less the one in France where the game takes place. Also for some strange reason I made it so that Aloïs had been raped by Justine, as well, and I think this was just a childish first attempt at shock value. </p>

<p>Then, the following scene takes place a few months (or was it years?) after the suitors had been hospitalized and undergoing intensive treatment. The cops and the girl who rescued them visit them and bring them flowers. My fan fiction was also set in the future. I actually chose the year to be 2014, so when I saw it years later, I thought it was really funny. In this timeline, scientists and doctors had developed a way to return eyesight to people who have lost their eyes, and the suitors received this treatment. Throughout my fan fiction, I had neglected to describe all the characters in too much detail, so I thought it was clever to now describe the way each character looks. There's also a touching moment between Aloïs and my obvious self-insert character, establishing the girl as his love interest.</p>

<p>And I wish I had ended it there, but then I made the biggest mistake in my short-lived fan fiction writing career and tried to write in a <em>musical number</em>. That's right. Remember how Malo was a violinist? Well, I end my fan fiction in the corniest way imaginable by having him play an 80s pop song on his violin and having the other characters dance and sing to it.</p>

<p>This song was "Always Something There to Remind Me" by Naked Eyes.</p>

<p class="caption">I swear it's like this band's music follows me.</p>

<p>Where was the logic in any of this? Only my 14 year old self remembers that.</p>

<p>One explanation I have is that I just liked the song, and I thought it would take a while for the characters to forget their trauma. Another explanation could be that the name of the band is Naked Eyes, and the suitors don't have eyes. While writing this post, I noticed that the North American and Japanese cover art for the album that this song is in, "Burning Bridges," has two beautiful disembodied green eyes staring back at the viewer. Suddenly I am reminded how some coincidences in writing stories can seem to have more meaning than they really do.</p>

<h4>The Crazy Story of How I Lost it</h4>

<p>I had uploaded my fan fiction to both my DeviantArt.com account and my FanFiction.net account. Sometime last year I stupidly decided to delete both accounts, thinking that I had saved it somewhere on my computer and my USB stick with all my childhood drawings and writings. It turned out that not only was my fan fiction not on my computer, but I had actually accidentally wiped that USB stick earlier in the year when I was installing some new operating systems on my computers. Stupidly, I didn't know that "format" meant to delete everything on it.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, I had asked Archive.org to exclude my old DeviantArt profiles from the Wayback Machine because I was embarrassed by the content on there, effectively destroying any chance I had of ever retrieving my fan fiction. I also thought I had given my boyfriend a copy of my fan fiction to read, but I had actually deleted it accidentally.</p>

<p>So yeah, basically I'm screwed. I really miss this fan fiction, and I hope someday I find it online somewhere. I have already tried for a whole day, so I ask you that if you or anyone you know somehow downloaded a copy of a weird fan fiction called "Help Arrives", please contact me on Twitter or via email about it. My Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/cozymaus" target="_blank">cozymaus</a>, and my email is <email></email>.</p>
