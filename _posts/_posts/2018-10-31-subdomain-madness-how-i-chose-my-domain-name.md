<p><first-letter>Y</first-letter>our website's domain is very important. You should make sure that it aligns with your brand and values, but it's even more important that you are happy with it because it's going to be something that you will always be seeing and using. In this post, I'm going to tell you the story behind my website's domain name <em>ByLiz.org</em>.</p>

<h3>What About My Name?</h3>

<p>My first instinct, after looking at so many artist and developer website portfolios and <em>YouTube </em>channels that were named after the creator's first name and last name, was to get a domain of my name. Unfortunately, I have made these purchases too soon because I hadn't considered the fact that whenever I tell people my last name on the phone, they have to ask me how to spell it. I realized too late that my name would be too hard to spell by ear and too hard to remember how to spell. I have a rare Hispanic surname, and in high school, my name would often get misspelled and mispronounced, to my annoyance. But now that I am older, I understand that I simply cannot use my own name as my brand name, especially since I will mostly have an English-speaking audience.</p>

<p>The other problem with picking that domain was that I eventually became paranoid of strangers finding where I lived through my name. Of course this fear was irrational, but I worried that if I gained a large audience, I would get creeps looking for where I lived through those scam online yellow pages. It also didn't help that the website I first registered my domain name with (Hosting24.com) didn't provide Whois data protection, so anybody could find your full address, phone number, and email that you used to register that domain name. For this reason, I highly recommend <a href="http://namecheap.com" target="_blank">NameCheap.com</a> for your domain-purchasing needs because it cloaks this information with their Whois Guard feature.</p>

<h3>What About a Fake Name?</h3>

<p>The next mistake I made was even worse. I invented a completely new name that nobody even knew me by and wasted money on a domain of it. I had spent money before on a domain that was a made up name, but at least that one was a username that I had been using online already. My paranoia stupidly led me to change my name on every online profile I owned to my fake name - <em>even my LinkedIn</em>. Once I got rid of every mention of my real name from my online presence, I felt stupid for trying to be somebody I'm not. </p>

<h3>What About a Creative Name?</h3>

<p>I decided to keep looking for a name that was more honest and that I would never get tired of. Using a brand name was not a good idea for me because my tastes were fickle, and I wanted something permanent so I could stop wasting money on names I would never use! I could have used <em>theTinkerSpace,</em> but the .com version of that domain was taken, and there were other active websites with the similar domain <em>TinkerSpace </em>that I didn't want people to confuse with my website. </p>

<p>I started to think, <em>Well, I make a bunch of different things, so maybe my domain can reflect that.</em> I think at the same time I was using the username <em>ByLiz</em> on <em>Github</em> and some variations of it on social media. I saw that Liz Butler, a graphic designer, was using the domain <em>MadeByLiz.com </em>as her domain, and it hit me that I could simply use <em>ByLiz </em>as a domain name!</p>

<p>Even though almost every TLD was taken for <em>ByLiz</em> by people who wanted to profit off it, it was bizarre that the second best one for SEO behind .com wasn't taken. I snatched up <em>ByLiz.org</em> and have been very happy with my purchase since. Not only is it short and sweet, it makes me look like I'm an original. I highly recommend trying out a combination like this for your domain name if you want something that can be applied to anything you make and still be 100% you.</p>

<h3>What About Subdomains?</h3>

<p>One of the best parts about this domain is that any subdomain looks <em>good</em>.</p>

<p>As you can see, I went kind of crazy assigning different subdomains to my profiles to make them faster to type. <a href="http://art.byliz.org" target="_blank">Art.ByLiz.org</a> redirects to my DeviantArt profile, <a href="http://yt.byliz.org" target="_blank">YT.ByLiz.org</a> redirects to my YouTube channel, <a href="http://links.byliz.org" target="_blank">Links.ByLiz.org</a> redirects to my profile links page I made myself, and so on. This is mainly what I love about my domain. Each of these addresses just roll off the tongue easily (except for the "dot" that I always have to say after the first segment), and they remind me that I have done a lot of things. I make websites, I make games, I make art, and the world knows that just with a name.</p>
