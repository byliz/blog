<p>For this video, I used a different style of video: a time-lapsed digital drawing, usually called a "speedpaint" or a "speeddrawing" online on content sharing sites such as YouTube or Instagram. This is the first time I have ever narrated a speedpaint of mine, and it was a bit of a nerve-wracking experience to say the least. I apologize for the crackling that you might hear at the beginning of the video. I used a different mic this time (the Blue Snowball), and I might have not have been placing it correctly! I will make sure to do a better job on my next videos.</p>

<p>Make sure to leave me a comment on the video if you would like more content like this and if there's anything you think I could improve to make videos like this more pleasant to listen to or watch.  Also tell me if you have any suggestions on what content I can make next, as I am always open to suggestions.</p>
