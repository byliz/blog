excerpt: "Finally I have new content on this site! It's been quite a while since I was able to post something new since I was so busy making changes to my websites. In this video I draw my bunny girl character with heterochromia iridum and rant about an obscure and under-discussed insecurity many people online share: an insecurity about eye color. I go over the strange things I have found as a product (or possible a cause) of this insecurity, share my personal experiences with this problem, and give my thoughts on the root cause as well as ways to improve it."
