<p>Based on the album cover of <a href="https://bl00dwave.bandcamp.com/album/--3" target="_blank">bl00dwave's</a>  ＮＥＷ ＶＩＳＵＡＬＳ, this piece I did back in late 2017, and it was like the beginning of something new in my art. I decided to experiment using a pixellated style that I will probably cover in a video. The style doesn't work with every piece, but when it works, it gives the work a very retro, neon aesthetic. Here I made two versions of this drawing playing around with filter colors. I like the pink version the best. This was also the first time I properly rendered my rabbit girl character, who I am thinking of using as the protagonist in my first indie game attempt.</p>

<p>This second piece was a redo of an earlier piece with the same pose. I decided to remake it using the new pixellated style I found, and the result was okay. I am very proud of the sweater, so I thought that this style captured the feeling that the original was lacking: this character is lovesick. At the same time, this was a further development of the idea I had for my first game as I am totally into the <em>menhera</em> style.</p>

<p>For this piece I went back to my cell-shaded style. I tried to use an interesting theme for this one, but I basically just wanted to draw Mother Mary with rabbit ears. No particular reason, really. I just like this imagery a lot. I like the original nose I drew in the sketch much more, but I changed it for the render for some reason. Making this image look more dark with the lighting behind the subject was fun, but I don't think it captured what the original sketch had. I also tried using RGB split for this image, and it produced three different versions. I think my favorites are the blue one and the purple one with the yellow moon.</p>

<p>As you can see by the sun behind my character in this image, I was listening to <a href="https://vanillabeats.bandcamp.com/album/origin" target="_blank">Vanilla's</a> Origin album a lot at the time. I wanted to remake my first drawing in a different style, and it came out kind of funky. I used a white border around the character and tons of filters. I don't like the full version of this image too much, but I like using the close-up of my character's face as a PFP sometimes.</p>

<p>This is some fanart I made of two characters form the video game series <em>Danganronpa</em>. Drawing the first one, Nagito Komaeda from <em>Danganronpa 2</em>, I discovered a lazy style using the pencil tool which I found I liked a lot. I will also cover this style in my art style video. </p>

<p>The second character, Kokichi Ouma from <em>Danganronpa V3</em>, I did a year later using the same style. I decided to make two versions because I was playing around with eye colors on my characters at the time. I like black beady eyes, but this character has purple eyes, so I made two versions because I felt like it. There's also a version without the purple lighting, and I made a GIF of that:</p>

<p>I actually took these poses the characters are in from scenes in the games, but I won't spoil which ones!</p>

<p>These two drawings are the same character drawn a few months apart. The first image is the second design of my original character, who was originally going to be my online mascot, but I can't stop changing her design and purpose! I did a silly <a href="{{ site.url }}/posts/making-my-oc-edgy-a-speedpaint-and-ramble-video" target="_blank">video</a> on the process of drawing this character. Also note that the first design is completely cell-shaded while the second design used some of the watercolor shading technique that I devised later.</p>

<p>Of course, like any good creator, I have found an even lazier way to make something look good. For this sketch, I decided to color over my pencil sketch digitally, and I was quite pleased with the result. I will be using this art style a little for rougher designs and concepts.</p>

<img src="https://lizlorena.com/img/lowcut-rgb-split.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

<p>For this one, I did a bunch of different things. I used a reference photo that I really liked, did lineart, and used watercolor brushes for painting and shading, and went crazy with the RGB split effect. It came out kind of freaky, which is what I was going for.</p>

<p>This one I am extremely happy with. I went back to the pixellated style that I was dying to use again and went crazy with gradients. This is my rabbit girl character again but closer in design to what I envisioned for the game I want to make. I came up with the colors after playing around on the <em>Gaia Online </em>avatar builder. That's also where the crazy star theme came from, but I do own a star ankle bracelet like that. Also, this is actually a render of a pencil drawing I made a year earlier.</p>

<p>Also, yes, she's holding price guns. It's complicated.</p>

<p>This time, it's my character again but looking more cutesy. I basically only made this because I felt I needed a cutesy avatar for my YouTube channel because I decided to rebrand a little (a lot). At this point I decided to go with <em>theTinkerSpace</em> as a channel name and username, and the name gives me visions of sparkly stars and cuteness. For this I went crazy with the sketchy style and a star brush that I used in my previous render.</p>

<p>My second most recent drawing was <em>this mess.</em> As you can see, I fell victim to a Twitter art trend for the first time in my life. I was itching to practice drawing <em>gesugao</em> faces, which is a term that means "warped evil smile" in anime and manga. And so I shamefully drew a big-breasted Princess Boo with a deranged expression and cowering ghosties behind her. I love ghosties. And I love my silly boyfriend who fell for this trend as well.</p>

<p>I really wanted to use my pixellated style, but it somehow looked awful, so I went back to using the safe cell-shaded style. Overall, I am sort of happy with it, but I can see what I can improve for next time.</p>

<p>Then I made this sheet of concept designs for the rivals to the protagonist of my future game. This one took ages because the file was huge, and it's quite a lot of characters. I went in and just colored over a sketch in FireAlpaca and then applied shading, highlights, and some line art. Don't think I'll be doing something like this again anytime soon!</p>

<p>I actually forgot to add this drawing because I drew it on the very last day of September! I drew this first digital art of my new "selfsona" to use in videos to express myself when not using a camera. She is named Tinker, and in this drawing she is a cat person. This isn't the first time I tried to actually design a character that could represent me, but it's definitely the time I am actually most satisfied with my design. I make a few more adjustments to her design in October, though.</p>
